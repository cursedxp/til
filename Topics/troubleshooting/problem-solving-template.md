## Tips for Good Documentation

1. **Be specific**: Include exact error messages and file paths
2. **Show your work**: Document the investigation process, not just the solution
3. **Think future-you**: Will you understand this in 6 months?
4. **Include context**: What were you trying to do when this happened?
5. **Add timestamps**: When did this happen? (for version-specific issues)

## Categories to Consider

- **Configuration Issues**: Wrong settings, syntax errors
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Version mismatches, missing packages
- **Environment Problems**: Path issues, permissions, system-specific bugs
- **Logic Errors**: Code bugs, algorithmic mistakes
- **Performance Issues**: Slow queries, memory leaks
- **Build/Deploy Issues**: CI/CD failures, compilation errors
