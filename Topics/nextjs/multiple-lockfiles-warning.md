## ‚ùå Next.js Multiple Lockfiles Warning

### Problem
```
‚ö† Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of /Users/anilozsoy/package-lock.json as the root directory.
```

### Root Cause
- Accidental `package.json` files in home directory
- Usually caused by running `npm install` in wrong directory

### Diagnosis Steps
1. `ls -la ~/` to check home directory
2. `npm list -g --depth=0` to verify global packages
3. Identify which files shouldn't be there

### Solution
```bash
cd ~
rm package.json package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules
```

### Prevention
- Always check `pwd` before npm commands
- Use `npm install -g` for CLI tools
- Keep project dependencies in project folders only

```javascript
// Wrong:
...compat.extends("next/core-web-vitals", "next/typescript,prettier")

// Right:
...compat.extends("next/core-web-vitals", "next/typescript", "prettier")
```
